How are you doing? Honestly not as good 
However,
I really like C++
I was hoping that I could transfer to CS
God has a plan for me
Maybe he didnt want me to transfer early because perhaps I woudln't have found that I want to
specialize in C/C++
And now I know!
And will become the best C/C++ engineer!!!
bye!
