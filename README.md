# Mim ~ A Minimal Improved Development Editor

Mim is an improved version of Vim. As a Vim enjoyer, I feel like Mim achieves most of the same tasks that Vim offers and on top of that, it add features like Syntax Highlighting, and hopefully Multiple Buffering of files (once I get it working! ðŸ˜…).

Check out a snapshot of mim.c in mim.
